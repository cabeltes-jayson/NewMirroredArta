These tables form the backbone of a simple inventory system. Depending on your needs, you can extend or modify the schema (e.g., adding a sales_table for sales transactions, or a warehouse_location_table to track inventory in multiple locations). Let me know if you'd like more details on any of these or if you need further clarification!

1. Products Table → Categories Table (One-to-Many Relationship)
Each product belongs to a specific category, but each category can contain many products. Therefore, the product_table will have a foreign key (category_id) that references the category_table.

Relationship: Each product belongs to one category, but each category can have many products.
Foreign Key: product_table.category_id references category_table.category_id.

2. Products Table → Suppliers Table (One-to-Many Relationship)
Each product is supplied by a specific supplier, but a supplier can provide multiple products. Therefore, the product_table will have a foreign key (supplier_id) that references the supplier_table.

Relationship: Each product comes from one supplier, but each supplier can supply many products.
Foreign Key: product_table.supplier_id references supplier_table.supplier_id.

3. Inventory Transactions Table → Products Table (One-to-Many Relationship)
Each inventory transaction (purchase, sale, or return) is associated with one product, but a product can have many transactions. So, the inventory_transaction_table will have a foreign key (product_id) that references the product_table.

Relationship: Each transaction involves one product, but a product can be involved in many transactions (e.g., multiple sales, returns, and restocks).
Foreign Key: inventory_transaction_table.product_id references product_table.product_id.

4. Inventory Transactions Table → Users Table (One-to-Many Relationship)
If you want to track which user performed a transaction (for example, who processed the sale or purchase), you would add a user_id foreign key to the inventory_transaction_table. This would link the transaction to a specific user.

Relationship: Each transaction is performed by one user, but each user can perform many transactions.
Foreign Key: inventory_transaction_table.user_id references user_table.user_id.

5. Purchases Table → Suppliers Table (One-to-Many Relationship)
Each purchase order is made from a specific supplier, but a supplier can have many purchase orders. Therefore, the purchase_table will have a foreign key (supplier_id) that references the supplier_table.

Relationship: Each purchase comes from one supplier, but a supplier can have multiple purchases.
Foreign Key: purchase_table.supplier_id references supplier_table.supplier_id.

6. Purchase Items Table → Products Table (One-to-Many Relationship)
Each line item in a purchase order refers to a specific product, but each product can be part of many purchase orders. Therefore, the purchase_item_table will have a foreign key (product_id) that references the product_table.

Relationship: Each purchase item corresponds to one product, but a product can be part of many purchase orders.
Foreign Key: purchase_item_table.product_id references product_table.product_id.

7. Purchase Items Table → Purchases Table (Many-to-One Relationship)
Each product in a purchase order belongs to a particular purchase order. The purchase_item_table will have a foreign key (purchase_id) referencing the purchase_table.

Relationship: Many purchase items belong to one purchase order.
Foreign Key: purchase_item_table.purchase_id references purchase_table.purchase_id.
